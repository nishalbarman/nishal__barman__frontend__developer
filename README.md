## Getting Started

Basic simple webpage coded with NextJs. I gave my best to convert the figma design to a live webpage. I added some simple animations and made it fully responsive for all devices.

## Run the development server

Just copy and paste the below commands going into the root directly

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Now you can visit the webpage at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
